If you depend on any third party library you are risking      // HL
that this library is broken, depends on stuff you don't like, // HL
won't compile, is evil, becomes unmaintained, gets deprecated // HL
by the vendor, is ruled to be illegal or gets changed in ways // HL
unsuitable to your need.  // HL
    - Volker Dobler
